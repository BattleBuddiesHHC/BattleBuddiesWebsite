	<p>Ms. Ayriana O'Bryant is the owner and founder of Battle Buddies Home Healthcare which was established in 2018. Ms. O'Bryant has over six years’ experience in the healthcare field. As a certified nurse assistant (CNA), Ms. O'Bryant has worked in a variety of settings, including a hospital, nursing homes, and patients’ homes. Her passion to help others has been a constant driving force in her work and service to the community. While working as a CNA Ms. O’Bryant saw the need to provide accessible and high-quality care in patients' homes which led to the establishment of this business. She truly believes that all people, no matter their socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, age, or past life experiences deserve high-quality and dependable home health care services. This work has brought her great joy and Ms. O’Bryant strives to provide this access to high-quality care to people in the southwest Michigan region as she continues to serve this community.<br><br> 
Ms. O’Bryant was born and raised in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and is a proud alumna of Kalamazoo Public Schools (Loy Norrix High School). She has completed college coursework at Kalamazoo Valley Community College and Wayne State University in Business. She is also very proud to have served her country in the United States Army Reserve for the past five years, her rank is Private First Class (E-3), and she serves the army as a petroleum supply specialist (92F).<br><br>
Service to others has always been a priority for Ms. O’Bryant. She has volunteered at numerous places in the community including but not limited to the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission and the Kalamazoo Loaves & Fishes. She also loves to travel and this curiosity in travel was sparked by being a part of Urban Youth for Africa in high school, which Provided Ms. O’Bryant the opportunity to travel to the capital of Senegal, Dakar. That experience was life-changing as she had an opportunity to experience the life of a Senegalese student, while also performing service to that community. She installed water purification systems in rural communities during that visit. <br><br>
Coming from a large and close tight-knit family, Ms. O’Bryant strives to build a company culture that treats clients as she would members of her own extended family. She is grateful that so many families in Southwest Michigan have entrusted her with the care of their loved ones and hopes that Battle Buddies Home Healthcare can be of service to more families in the region soon!
